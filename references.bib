              the art. We present a consolidated discussion on the leveraging
              of various sensing modalities along with modular server-side and
              on-device architectures required for this task. Modalities
              included are: activity monitoring from accelerometry and location
              sensing, audio analysis of speech, image processing for facial
              expressions as well as modern methods for effective patient
              self-reporting. We review examples that deliver actionable
              information to clinicians and patients while addressing privacy,
              usability, and computational constraints. We also discuss open
              challenges in the higher level inferencing of patient state and
              effective feedback with potential directions to address them. The
              methods and challenges presented here are also generalizable and
